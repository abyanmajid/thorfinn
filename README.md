# KindStack (WIP)

Kickstart your distributed solution with ergonomic, extensible, and fully documented Rust APIs. Own your all of your infrastructure; KindStack's architecture is made for self-hosting on a VPS, using an orchestrator like Docker Compose, Swarm, or Kubernetes. It is NOT built to work with serverless and cloud-dependent philosophies.
