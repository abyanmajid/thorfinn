**_CAUTION:_** Orion is not yet fully stable and is still being tested against many web vulnerabilities.

One way we're measuring progress in this regard is by going through the OWASP complete list of web vulnerabilities. You can see our progress [here](#).

---

Orion is a simple, framework-agnostic, Go-extensible auth server that has everything you need to secure your applications:

- Credentials provider _(with OAuth2 and WebAuthn arriving in the next major release, v2)_
- Two-factor authentication: TOTPs via Authenticator Apps, Email, and SMS
- Stateless session management with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `Samesite`, `Path=/` Cookies to maximize protection against web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Request throttling and fine-grained in-memory ratelimitting via token buckets
- Node.js SDK to seamlessly integrate Orion into your frontend applications with guarantees for type-safe HTTP calls.
  - Alternatively, you can also import our entire Node.js SDK into 1 file.

## Usage

### As a dedicated auth microservice

WIP.

### As a starter for monolithic backends

WIP.

### As a single-sign on (SSO) server

WIP.
