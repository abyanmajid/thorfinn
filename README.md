# OpenYan Identity

A free and open-source Auth0, Clerk, and Okta alternative. Chuck this lightweight microservice into the infrastructure of your next project to have an instant authentication and authorization solution that is completely decoupled from your main backend systems.

OpenYan Identity offers all you need for authentication and authorization out of the box:

- Credentials and OAuth Providers
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with Authenticator Apps, Email OTPs, SMS OTPs, and WebAuthn (Passkeys)
- Session Management with JSON Web Tokens and Database Sessions
- Single Sign-On (SSO) Web Interface
- Framework-Agnostic SDKs for Client-Side Authorization (Go and TypeScript are currently available)

You just have to include the necessary environment secrets (e.g., OAuth Client IDs and Secrets), and you're ready to deploy this microservice.
