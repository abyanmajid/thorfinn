Novus is a simple, framework-agnostic, Go-extensible auth server with everything you need to secure your applications:

- Multiple providers: Credentials, OAuth2, WebAuthn (Passkeys)
- Two-factor authentication: TOTPs via Authenticator Apps, Email, and SMS
- Stateless session management with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `Samesite`, `Path=/` Cookies to maximize protection against web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Ratelimiting and throttling utilities with an in-memory implementation (for servers) and a key-value store implementation (for serverless)
- Node.js SDK to seamlessly integrate Novus into your frontend applications with guarantees for type-safe HTTP calls.

**OWASP:** Novus has been tested, and therefore made to defend, against a lot from the OWASP list of web vulnerabilities, particularly following this [cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/index.html). More tests will be conducted.
